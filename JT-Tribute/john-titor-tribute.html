          <p>John Titor is a famous man among those to acclaimed to be a time traveler. He first appeared sometime in the year 2000(though no one really knows) on a science/physics forum with the username of Timetravel_0 and eventually revealed himself as a time traveler who came from the future. John said he was from the year 2036 and posted pictures of his time traveling machine.</p>
        
          <p>On this forum there were many people asking questions about why he decided to come to our time. People also wanted to know more about how time traveling works. Some had questions about his time traveling machine, and others had questions about his personal views about our current time.</p>
        
          <p>What's notable about Titor is that although he said he wouldn't tell us about our future, he did mention some things that were considered predictions. And some of those predictions seems to have come true, making John Titor seem like the real deal. For example, though he never revealed concrete information about 9/11, it seemed as though he was giving hints about it's upcoming occurance.</p>
        
          <p>In 2001 John said he was returning to his own timeline. Once he left he was never heard from again. However, to this day there are people who are still waiting for his return.</p>

          <h3>Why Did John Titor Travel Time?</h3>
          <p>Let's briefly talk about what Titor's goal was in traveling 36 years back in time. In one of his post Titor said he was sent to retreive the a computer called IBM 5100. In 2036 the IBM 5100 was needed because, as he stated, "it has the ability to read the older IBM programming languages in addition to APL and Basic." The IBM 5100 had the ability to help debug legacy computer programs in his timeline.<p>
          <p>Not only that, but in his timeline the IBM 5100 was known to be able to read all code from any IBM series. And, as John puts it, it was unfortunate that there were no IBM 5100 left on his world line.</p>

          <p>Titor also said that the 5100 had a technical ability that was known by IBM but wasn't published. The author/host from the <a id="tribute-link" href="johntitor.com" target="_blank">John Titor website</a> speculates that the information was hidden by IBM possibly because it could have affected other business IBM was doing.</p>

              <p>"I get no pleasure out of being right when it comes to CJD disease, war in the Middle East or suffering people in far away lands. There's nothing like the look on someone's face when you tell them 100,000 people will be dead tomorrow. In my travels, I have discovered that most people really don't want to know about the future because if its different than what they want it ticks them off. Actually, I don't blame them. "<p>

                <p>"Naturally, the conflict in Vietnam and the Middle East come up but as someone has already stated here, "that's old news". I suppose I could predict the failure of Apollo 13 spacecraft but since time travel is ridiculous, I would be blamed for sabotage. I might even decide to tell you about an earthquake in Peru but then people that would have died by chance will now live and vice versa."<p>

A tsunami was generated by this earthquake that killed at least 20 people in the Caman√°-Chala region.
